                <h4>Here's how it works:</h4>
                
                
                <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; margin-top: 20px;">As a Buyer:</p>
                
                <p>You can join for free, and purchase the products online.<br>
                Payment is by Credit Card Only, so it's safe.<br>
                Shipping is free with the items you purchased so no need to look.<br>
                Buy & Sell is responsible for your purchase and delivery, so you only deal with us, not with the seller (that's our job)<br>
                We will not release the money to the seller until you have received your item, and you are happy with the purchase.<br>
                Customer service is online chat for your convenience if you have any problems.</p>
                
                <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">As a seller:</p>

               <p> Signing up is free<br>
                You can post your items online for free<br>
                When you sell your items, you will be given delivery options, or you can choose your own.<br>
                If you send the product outside of Bescow's System, you can add the tracking number, so the buyer can see it's on its way.<br>
                You will not deal directly with the customer (that's our job)<br>
                Once your item has been delivered, and all is good, Buy & Sell will send you the payment to your nominated bank account (less 5% sellers fee, and delivery if you use our service)</p>
                
                <p style="font-weight: 600;">Customer service is online chat for your convenience if you have any problems.</p>
                
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">You're all Set.</p> <p></p>
